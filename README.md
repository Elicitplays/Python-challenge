# Python-challenge
This is the python challenge for the DU Bootcamp
For those of you reading this, this assignment was a doozy.
Problems that have been persistent were more within the PyBank assignment
Problems that annoyed the heck out of me were getting a string out of bounds error
and a couple others that weren't fun. 
Otherwise everything else should work perfectly.
Some feedback.
Please provide formulas to how you computed some results. I understand how to write the math
but would like some generic math formulas that would ease in answering what is asked.
